# AI-Driven-E-commerce growth engine

Domain:
The project falls under the E-Commerce and Retail Analytics domain. Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of online retail businesses, as it helps in understanding customer behavior, improving marketing strategies, and increasing sales.

Context of the Dataset:
The dataset consists of transactional records from an e-commerce business. Each row represents a sales invoice with details such as invoice number, product stock code, product description, quantity purchased, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and the country from which the order was placed. The data can be used to analyze customer purchasing patterns, identify high-value customers, and segment them based on their shopping behavior.

Attribute Information:
InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction (invoice).

StockCode: Unique identifier for each product.

Description: Name of the product.

Quantity: Number of units purchased in a particular invoice.

InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.

UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product.

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer (helps in customer segmentation).

Country: The country where the transaction took place.
